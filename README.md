# JavaScript Debugging Demo

This is a simple JavaScript debugging project that showcases common errors and how to fix them. It includes short, focused examples to practice identifying and correcting issues in variable scope, data types, arithmetic operations and logic. 

## What This Project Covers

Each section in 'script.js' demonstrates a different type of bug and its corresponding fix. 

Topics Include:

- **String vs. Number Addition**
- **Incorrect Averages**
- **Variable Scope**
- **Function Misuse**
- **Console Logging Issues**
- And more to come...

## Files Included

- 'index.html' - Basic structure for testing JS in the browser.
- 'script.js' - Core file containing debugging examples and fixed versions.
- *(More files will be added as project grows)*

## Work In Progress

This is an on-going project and will continue to grow as I add more examples and improve each debugging scenario. Stay tuned for updates!

## How to Run

You can view results by either:

- Opening 'index.html' in a browser (with the script linked).
- Running 'node script.js' in a terminal if you have Node.js installed.
