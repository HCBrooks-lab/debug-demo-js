# JavaScript Debugging Demo

This is a simple JavaScript debugging project that showcases common errors and how to fix them. It includes short, focused examples to practice identifying and correcting issues in variable scope, data types, arithmetic operations and logic. 

---

## Current Tests

- bugs/bug1-offby-one.test.js
  Checks for an off-by-one in a function that returns the first N items from the list.

- bugs/bug2-floatpoint.test.js
  Validates floating-point addition with tolerance (0.1 + 0.2 â‰ˆ 0.3).

- script.js
  Runs the full script.js file and verifies expected console output.

---

## Future Additions/Improvements

- # Transition to Separate Test Files:
  For efficiency, the current script.js will remain as-is, containing all existing bugs and fixes
  in one file. From this point forward, new bugs/fixes will each be developed in their dedicated f
  file. This will make it easier to isolate, debug, and maintain individual test cases while still
  preserving the current consolidated version for reference.

- # Expanded Coverage:
  Will continue adding tests for edge cases, error handling, and unusual inputs, especially for
  new features or logic changes.

## Files Included

- 'index.html' - Basic structure for testing JS in the browser.
- 'script.js' - Core file containing debugging examples and fixed versions.
- *(More files will be added as project grows)*

## Work In Progress

This is an on-going project and will continue to grow as I add more examples and improve each debugging scenario. Stay tuned for updates!

## How to Run

You can view results by either:

- Opening 'index.html' in a browser (with the script linked).
- Running 'node script.js' in a terminal if you have Node.js installed.
